# 🛠️ CoffeeCanCoding

**CoffeeCanCoding** is inspired by the concept of **Coffee Can Investing** — but instead of investing money, we invest **time and effort** into solving coding problems in a consistent and deliberate manner. Just like a coffee can investment, this repository is a "set it and forget it" approach to improving your coding skills.

## 📜 Philosophy

1. **Consistency Over Perfection**: Focus on solving problems regularly, not on chasing perfect solutions.
2. **Static Problem Set**: Problems are "locked" once added, providing a fixed reference point for growth.
3. **Long-Term Growth**: The results of coding efforts accumulate over time, just like a coffee can investment.
